                    I created the bestselling Udemy course on React, now I'm super excited to share this course on NextJS with you - an in-depth course about an amazing React framework that allows you to take the next step as a React developer and build real, production-ready projects with React and Next.js!

                    Next.js is the production-ready, fullstack-capable framework for ReactJS - the most popular JavaScript library you can learn these days!

                    Too many buzzwords for your taste?

                    Fair enough - but indeed, NextJS is a great choice for growing as a React developer and for taking your React apps to the next level!

                    In detail, this course will cover:

                    What is NextJS? And why would you use it?

                    Why is just React (in many cases) not enough?

                    Creating NextJS projects from the ground up understanding these projects

                    Working with file-based routing

                    Adding dynamic routes and catch-all routes

                    Implementing different forms of page pre-rendering and server-side rendering

                    Working with data and adding data fetching + pre-fetching to your apps

                    Pre-generating dynamic and static pages

                    Adding optimizations like metadata to pages
